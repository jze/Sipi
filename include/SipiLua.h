 * This module implements a new Lua datatype, "SipiImage"
 * This datatype is used to manipulate the Sipi::Image c++ class
 * The following Lua functions are implemented:
 *
 *    img = SipiImage.new("filename")
 *    img = SipiImage.new("filename",{region=<iiif-region-string>, size=<iiif-size-string> | reduce=<integer>})
 *    dims = SipiImage.dim(img) -- returns table { nx=<nx>, ny=<ny> }
 *    SipiImage.write(img, <filepath>)
 *    SipiImage.send(img, format)
